# IRL MVP Notes

This repo is an MVP implementation of the IRL concept to showcase an inference-time validation approach.
It is intentionally small, with one structured domain plugin (NFL invariants) and a simple demo.

Next steps for expansion:
- Add claim extraction via JSON schema (LLM/tool-assisted)
- Add selective verification adapters (standings, schedule)
- Add more domain plugins (timezones, finance, weather)
- Add logging/audit trails and a simple proxy API
